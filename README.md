# Readme
This repository contains various content relating to my research. 

- These are the slides for a presentation on [NeSVoR](nesvor/index.html) ([paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/NeSVoR_Implicit_Neural_Representation_for_Slice-to-Volume_Reconstruction_in_MRI/21398868/1)), a method based on implicit neural representation for slice-to-volume reconstruction, focusing on fetal brain MRI.

Slides are based on [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) and themes from [remark-it](https://github.com/1-2-3/remark-it).
